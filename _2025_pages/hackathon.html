        <h2>Revolutionizing Athletics Through Technology</h2>

        <p>AthTech presents <strong>TrHackathon</strong>, a global virtual innovation challenge calling upon the brightest minds in technology and sports to transform how fans experience athletics. This competition brings together data scientists, developers, designers, and any technology/athletics enthusiasts to create groundbreaking solutions that will shape the future of track and field, combined events and road races.</p>
        
        <p>We're seeking visionary concepts that leverage <strong>emerging technologies</strong> to enhance fan engagement, athlete performance understanding and competition visualizations. Whether through immersive XR experiences, AI-driven analytics, wearable integrations, or novel data visualizations, your ideas will help evolve athletics.</p>

        <h2>Built on Top of Real Competition Data</h2>
        <p>Participants will be provided with real competition datasets that will be available in a GitHub repository. Teams are required to build their ideas and solutions using the official datasets. Furthermore, they also can consider external libraries or APIs, or any other technologies.</p>

        <h2>We ❤️ Innovative Ideas</h2>
        <p>We welcome ideas of projects to cover any area of innovation in athletics competition, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Immersive fan experiences (e.g., VR, AR solutions)</li>
            <li>Next-Generation Data Visualization (e.g., intuitive dashboards, broadcast graphics, or stadium displays)</li>
            <li>Competition storytelling (e.g., narrative-driven tools that help fans understand athletics events, particularly in disciplines like combined events, jumps or throws)</li>
            <li>Real-Time engagement solutions (e.g., predictive analytics, interactive voting, or personalized content delivery)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><em>Don't see your idea here? Don't worry, we welcome all innovative concepts</em></p>

        
        <h3>What to Deliver</h3>
        <p>
            Participants are expected to generate ideas for solutions, products, and services to increase the efficiency of competition management, fan engagement, or any other aspect contributing to the sport's digitalization. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The projects will be (briefly) documented in a website, PDF, presentation, or code repository, available on the web. If the project is a proof-of-concept or pilot, we recommended to link the code repository, app or demonstrative videos from the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            The public document must include at least the following sections: <strong>Abstract</strong> with the summary; <strong>Description</strong> of the project with use cases, challenges that solve, etc.; <strong>Innovation</strong>, with creative and unique aspects of the solution; <strong>Impact</strong>, including the potential of the project to transform athletics experiences (and who will benefit); <strong>Feasibility</strong>, with the description of if the idea is realistic or what is needed to create it. 
        </p>
        <p><em>Tips:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Be creative! Any outcome will be welcome, but have a look at the <a href="#evaluation">evaluation criteria</a> first.
            </li>
            <li>
                The simpler, the better. One or two paragraphs would be enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add pictures or videos to help us understand how cool your idea is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ask in <a href="https://forum.openathletics.net/">the forum</a>.
            </li>
        </ul> 
  
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Register your interest by starting a thread in <a href="https://forum.openathletics.net/">the forum</a> and tell us about your ideas. This does not commit you to going ahead.</li>
            <li>Be ready for an interim check-in around 14 July. We can either meet you online 1:1, or you can give a short 5-minute update during a public online meeting, as you prefer.</li>
            <li>Submit your project by 1<sup>st</sup> September.</li>
            <li>Be ready for an on-screen presentation to the judges in the first two weeks of September.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Teams of 1~3 members are welcome.</p>
        
       
        <h2>The Prize</h2>
        
        <p>
            The winning team will receive tickets to the next European Championships (Birmingham, UK, 2026); and will be invited to present in person at AthTech, with all expenses (from within Europe) covered by European Athletics.
        </p>

        <h2>Data & Tools for the Challenge</h2>
