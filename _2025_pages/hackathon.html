        <h2>Revolutionizing Athletics Through Technology</h2>
        <p>AthTech presents <strong>TrHackathon</strong>, a global virtual innovation challenge calling upon the brightest minds in technology and sports to transform how fans experience athletics. This competition brings together data scientists, developers, designers, and any technology/athletics enthusiasts to create groundbreaking solutions that will shape the future of track and field, combined events and road races.</p>
        
        <p>We're seeking visionary concepts that leverage <strong>emerging technologies</strong> to enhance fan engagement, athlete performance understanding and competition visualizations. Whether through immersive XR experiences, AI-driven analytics, wearable integrations, or novel data visualizations, your ideas will help evolve athletics.</p>

        <h2>Built on Top of Real Competition Data</h2>
        <p>Participants will be provided with real competition datasets that will be available in a GitHub repository. Teams are required to build their ideas and solutions using the official datasets. Furthermore, they also can consider external libraries or APIs, or any other technologies.</p>
        <h2>We ❤️ Innovative Ideas</h2>
        <p>We welcome ideas of projects to cover any area of innovation in athletics competition, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Immersive fan experiences (e.g., VR, AR solutions)</li>
            <li>Next-Generation Data Visualization (e.g., intuitive dashboards, broadcast graphics, or stadium displays)</li>
            <li>Competition storytelling (e.g., narrative-driven tools that help fans understand athletics events, particularly in disciplines like combined events, jumps or throws)</li>
            <li>Real-Time engagement solutions (e.g., predictive analytics, interactive voting, or personalized content delivery)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><em>Don't see your idea here? Don't worry, we welcome all innovative concepts</em></p>
