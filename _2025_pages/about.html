      <p>AthTech, the Athletics Technology Conference, is a meeting place for all the people working behind the scenes to make the sport more enjoyable and easier to manage.</p>

      <p>Previous editions focused on standardisation and data flows to help countries digitize the sport and save time, and on how all the data and content can be used, to offer great user experiences to athletes and fans or to improve the economics of the sport.</p>   
      <p>Come and hear from <a href="https://worldathletics.org/">World Athletics</a> and <a href="http://www.european-athletics.org/">European Athletics</a>, from member federations, race organisers and service providers, to be at the cutting edge of the sport!</p>
        
      <p>This conference is open to anyone interested in <strong>any topic related to technology and sports</strong>. from anywhere in the world</p>

    <h2> Practical information</h2>
    <p>Detailed information on logistics, accommodation and booking are being developed and will be published shortly, but we expect this will run as the previous conferences have done:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no fee to attend, other than the fair cost of accommodation and meals.</li>
        <li>European Athletics will invite one person per European federation, if they have a relevant contribution to make. Further delegates may attend at the federation's expense</li>
        <li>Further delegates from within and outside Europe, companies, vendors, and suppliers will be offered to stay in the hotel nearby at a competitive price.</li>
        <li>There will be a process to reserve accommodation published shortly</li>
        <li>Transport to and from Bologna airport, and possibly others, will be organised</li>
    </ul>
