      <p>AthTech, the Athletics Technology Conference, is a meeting place for all the people working behind the scenes to make the sport more enjoyable and easier to manage.</p>

      <p>Previous editions focused on standardisation and data flows to help countries digitize the sport and save time. This time, we will focus on how all the data and content can be used, to offer great user experiences to athletes and fans or to improve the economics of the sport.</p>   
      <p>Come and hear from <a href="https://worldathletics.org/">World Athletics</a> and <a href="http://www.european-athletics.org/">European Athletics</a>, from member federations, race organisers and service providers, to be at the cutting edge of the sport!</p>
        
      <p>This conference is open to anyone interested in <strong>any topic related to technology and sports</strong>.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Mission</h2>

      <blockquote>Standards and best practices for Athletics</blockquote>

      <p>Standard infrastructure for Athletics data management will enable a common mechanism to gain effectiveness and efficiency in the process of collecting and sharing data on a global scale. We will be able to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>enhance administrative performance</li>
        <li>innovate and design new intelligent services</li>
        <li>enable federation of resources in an automatic way;</li>
        <li>establish universal identifiers for athletes, clubs, and other entities;</li> 
        <li>access better reports;</li> 
        <li>track competition issues, and records;</li>
        <li>have centralised up-to-date rankings;</li> 
        <li>create and publish live results; </li>
        <li>create new services and products on top of the data.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>The common Athletics infrastructure follows the open data paradigm, encouraging the publication of data in standard formats and under permissive re-use licenses. This will bring us successful services and innovative products —made by federations or by third parties— that will affect the sport in a positive way.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Audience</h2>

      <p>AthTech is open to anyone. Among the attendees there will be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Athletics federations;</li>
        <li>data management experts;</li>
        <li>event organisers;</li>
        <li>training-device makers;</li>
        <li>sports clubs;</li>
        <li>sports services providers</li>
        <li>sports enthusiasts, and others.</li>
      </ul>
